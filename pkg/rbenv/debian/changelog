rbenv (0.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Paul van Tilburg ]
  * debian/watch: fixed the URL pattern.

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/patches/0001-Add-system-plugins-dir.patch: Read plugins from
    /usr/lib/rbenv/plugins as well.
  * The rbenv-alternatives plugin now also sets GEM_HOME so that gems are
    installed inside ~/.rbenv/versions/$version/gems instead of system-wide.
    Users are being warned of this fact through debian/NEWS. (Closes: #654550)
