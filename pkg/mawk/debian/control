Description: Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. 
  .
  The AWK language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
  processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk is a 
  new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho, Kernighan 
  and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley Publishing, 
  1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms to the POSIX 
  1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language which contains a few 
  features not described in the AWK book, and mawk provides a small number 
  of extensions. 
  .
  Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time limits 
  such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.
