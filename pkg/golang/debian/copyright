Notes:
 This is a copy of http://google-perftools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/pprof
 with local modifications to handle generation of SVG images and
 the Go-style pprof paths.  These modifications will probably filter
 back into the official source before long.
 It's convenient to have a copy here because we need just the one
 Perl script, not all the C++ libraries that surround it.

 This file contains the assembly language and machine code for
 Spacewar!, the original PDP-1 video game.  It is downloaded from
 http://spacewar.oversigma.com/sources/sources.zip which has
 the following notice at http://spacewar.oversigma.com/:
 .
      Spacewar! was conceived in 1961 by Martin Graetz, Stephen Russell,
      and Wayne Wiitanen. It was first realized on the PDP-1 in 1962 by
      Stephen Russell, Peter Samson, Dan Edwards, and Martin Graetz,
      together with Alan Kotok, Steve Piner, and Robert A Saunders.
      Spacewar! is in the public domain, but this credit paragraph must
      accompany all distributed versions of the program.
 .
      This is the original version! Martin Graetz provided us with a
      printed version of the source. We typed in in again - it was about
      40 pages long - and re-assembled it with a PDP-1 assembler written
      in PERL. The resulting binary runs on a PDP-1 emulator written as
      a Java applet. The code is extremely faithful to the original. There
      are only two changes. 1)The spaceships have been made bigger and
      2) The overall timing has been special cased to deal with varying
      machine speeds.
 .
      The "a", "s", "d", "f" keys control one of the spaceships. The "k",
      "l", ";", "'" keys control the other. The controls are spin one
      way, spin the other, thrust, and fire.

 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 .
   a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
 .
   b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
      object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also
      apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the
      Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
      such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
      by the Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor
      shall not apply to (i) any other combinations which include the
      Contribution, nor to (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No
      hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
 .
   c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
      to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
      Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
      disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other
      entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
      otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
      hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
      any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
      third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute
      the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
      before distributing the Program.
 .
   d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
      copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
      license set forth in this Agreement.
 .
 3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
 A. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this
 Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:
 .
   a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
 .
   b. if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a
      copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is included
      with each copy of the Program; and
 .
   c. if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license
      agreement:
       i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
          and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
          conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
          conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
      ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
          damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
          consequential damages, such as lost profits; and
     iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
          offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.
 .
 B. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in
 the Program:
 .
     Copyright (C) 2003, Lucent Technologies Inc. and others. All Rights Reserved.
 .
 C. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
 Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to
 identify the originator of the Contribution. Also, each Contributor must agree
 that the additions and/or changes are intended to be a Contribution. Once a
 Contribution is contributed, it may not thereafter be revoked.
 .
 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
 respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
 intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who
 includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
 which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a
 Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
 Distributor ("Commercial Distributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
 every Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and
 costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
 actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
 extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in
 connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
 offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
 relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
 to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
 Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor
 to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and
 any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
 participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 .
 For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product
 offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If
 that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers
 warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
 such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
 Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors
 related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
 any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor
 must pay those damages.
 .
 5. NO WARRANTY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
 "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
 NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
 Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
 and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
 exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the
 risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
 or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
 operations.
 .
 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
 CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
 SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
 LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
 CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
 ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
 EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
 OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. EXPORT CONTROL
 .
 Recipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance with the
 United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws
 and regulation of any other countries).
 .
 8. GENERAL
 .
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
 remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
 parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
 necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect
 to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in
 a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
 Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
 is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
 entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
 or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
 rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
 litigation is filed.
 .
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
 comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
 not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
 such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
 Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
 reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
 and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
 and survive.
 .
 LUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from
 time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
 version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
 distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
 received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
 Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
 under the new version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this
 Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
 Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
 Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel
 or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
 Agreement are reserved.
 .
 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
 intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
 Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
 after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
 in any resulting litigation.

 This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December
 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that
 this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the
 W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references
 to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the
 ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the
 previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software
 Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification
 under the Open Source Definition.

License: CC-BY-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
 THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
      includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which
      the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
      form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
      phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
      with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 .
   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
      than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the
      selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
      intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
      entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
      contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
      in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
      whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
      considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of
      this License.
 .

      and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through
      sale or other transfer of ownership.

      that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 .
   e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
      work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who

      performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
      persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
      otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of
      folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the
      person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
      performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
      broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
 .
   f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
      terms of this License including without limitation any
      production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
      whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including
      digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
      lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
      entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or
      without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated
      works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work
      of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
      lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
      expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of
      applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
      three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
      architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
      phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected
      as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or
      circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
      literary or artistic work.
 .
   g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this
      License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
      License despite a previous violation.
 .
   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
      Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations,
      by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or
      public digital performances; to make available to the public
      Works in such a way that members of the public may access these
      Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
      to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and

      images.
 .
   i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means

 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
 reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
 arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
 connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections;
 .
   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
      identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
      example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
      translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
      indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
      incorporated in Collections; and,
 .
   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
   e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
	i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
	   jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
	   through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot
	   be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
	   collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
           rights granted under this License;
 .
       ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
	   in which the right to collect royalties through any
	   statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
	   Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
	   royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
           under this License; and,
 .
      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
	   collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
	   that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
	   administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
	   from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
           License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
 now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to
 make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
 rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
 rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
      copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
      offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of
      this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
      exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
      the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
      intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
      disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
      measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
      the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
      applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
      does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
      made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
      Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
      Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested.
 .
   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
      Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
      made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
      for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
      are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
      pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
      Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
      a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
      service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
      parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
      extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
      specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
      not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
      the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
      of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
      the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
      Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
      Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may
      be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
      in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
      credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
      the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
      credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
      the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
      may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
      of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
      Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
      explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
      endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
      Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
      the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
      Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
      be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
      part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
      mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
      the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
      (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
      Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
      would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
      other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
      appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
      the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
      exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
      make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
 STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
 TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
 SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
 LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
 EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License.  Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
      or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
      Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
      this License.
 .
   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
      to You under this License.
 .
   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
      on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
      under this License.
 .
   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver

      WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
